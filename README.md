# Deep Learning Video Recognition Study

Welcome to our comprehensive exploration of two cutting-edge video recognition architectures in Deep Learning: 3D CNN and the CNN-RNN hybrid architecture. ðŸŽ¥ðŸš€

## About the Research

This research journey was an exciting collaboration involving a team of three, working under the guidance of our mentor at SRMUAP. Over a span of 5 months, we delved deep into the world of video recognition technologies to unravel the nuances of these powerful architectures.

## Dataset and Comparison

Our work is centered around the evaluation of different video recognition and classification technologies. We carefully selected two prominent architectures and meticulously compared their accuracy and error rates. To maintain consistency, we conducted our comparison on a common dataset, a subset of the renowned UCF dataset. ðŸ“Š

## Results and Findings

In our research paper (also available in this repository), we present a detailed analysis of the two models. You'll find a comprehensive breakdown of accuracy rates, error rates, and other significant results that emerged from our experimentation.

Feel free to explore the findings, and we hope this study provides valuable insights into the exciting realm of video recognition in Deep Learning! ðŸš€âœ¨

**Happy Exploring!** ðŸŒŸ
